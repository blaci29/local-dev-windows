Python/Flask
  - Use def for function definitions.
  - Use type hints for all function signatures where possible.
  - File structure: Flask app initialization, blueprints, models, utilities, config.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
  - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
  - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).
